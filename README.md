# SRGAN-And-Image-Fusion-For-Remote-Sensing-Imagery
Image fusion is a technique used to combine multiple images to create a single image that contains relevant and important information from all the images. It helps us to get better insights of the images. In order to get a better outcome of the image fusion technique we use deep learning models like SRGAN to enhance the image before sending it for image fusion. This will result in a better fusion process and hence provides us with more details.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In remote sensing applications, SRGAN-based image fusion can generate high-resolution composite images from lowresolution images that have been captured by different sensors or platforms. This technique can improve the overall accuracy and resolution of remote sensing data, which is important for various applications, such as crop monitoring, land-use mapping, and disaster response.
